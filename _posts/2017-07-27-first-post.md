title: The Goals of Unnamed City Builder
---

I've been a fan of simulation games since my family got its first PC back in 1999 or 2000. Roller Coaster Tycoon, Railroad Tycoon, SimCity 4, Industry Giant, Capitalism, etc. There are two reasons people enjoy games like these:

1. To satisfy a creative itch. Building a big city in Simcity, building roller coasters in Roller Coaster Tycoon, building elaborate train networks in Railroad Tycoon.
2. The challenge of fighting against the simulation to accomplish your goal. 

I play simulation games mostly due to no. 2. That's the reason why recent city building games, including the newest SimCity and Cities: Skylines, have been major disappointments for me. I enjoyed both games for a few hours, but it very quickly became clear that the underlying simulations were extremely shallow. I felt like the decisions I made were largely irrelevant, and I never found myself challenged. Each game ultimately boiled down to laying down roads, setting zones, and plopping down whatever buildings were needed to make people happy, ad infinitum. Unlike SimCity 4, where overbuilding schools and police stations could get you into a lot of trouble, it's almost impossible to run out of money in these "modern" city builders. And making things cost more would only make the game slower, not harder, since the simulations lack any real depth.

SimCity and Cities: Skylines are aimed at players who enjoy these games for reason no. 1 above. That's perfectly fine, but it's no my cup of tea. My disappontment in SimCity led me to be begin building a simulation game of my own. It doesn't have a name yet, and it's not yet a game, only a collection of building blocks. It's been a spare-time project - a few hours here, a few hours there. Weeks and months would sometimes go by without working on it at all. I've gotten more consistent about dedicating time to the game, but it can be draining.

I feel like the core components are starting to take shape and meld together, and that's why I'm beginning this blog to chronicle development. The path ahead will be long, and I'd put the odds of me ever finishing this thing well below even-money. But even after years of slowly and inconsistently hacking away, I still find myself excited to work on it.  

***

Let me lay out what I aim to create. The core concepts of Unnamed City Builder are listed below:

1. Every citizen is simulated, making decisions as basic as choosing which deoderant to buy at the store (and which store to go to, and which route to take, etc.) and as complex as deciding whether to start a business. There will be no "systems," i.e. crime systems, economic systems, etc. Crime, the economy, and all other collective phenomena will emerge from the simulation of a large number citizens.

2. The timescale of the game will be realistic. SimCity and Cities: Skylines are forced to use different time scales for different things. Example: A car may take two weeks of game time to reach its desination. That won't fly when the goal is to simulate a real economy. This means that the game will need to run at a large multiple of real time, which may very well be impossible with a large number of citizens. 

3. Individual items will be tracked. This is necessary if statistical systems are to be avoided. A person buys a new tube of toothpaste when they're close to running out of toothpaste. That tube of toothpaste is manufactured in a factory and transported to a store (or a distribution center and then a store) before it ultimately ends up in a person's bathroom. All of that has to be simulated, which is a daunting prospect.

I hope to also allow the player to run a business. While I'm calling this game "Unnamed City Builder" for now, I envision a combination of SimCity and Capitalism. The simulation will certainly be deep enough to faciliate this.

Because of these goals, this game may end up being "Unnamed Town Builder" instead. But I have some ideas on how to make things go fast.

I hope to write about the various systems that will make up the game in this blog, as well as routinely document progress and developments. This will be a slow and painful slog for sure, and there will be times when nothing gets done for weeks at a time. It's been a lot of "two steps forward, one step back" over the past few years, and I don't expect that to change. But I'm optimistic that all of the pieces will eventually fall into place.

Until next time.
